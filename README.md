🚢 Exploring Data with the Titanic Dataset – A Hands-On Analytics Project 📊

Excited to share my latest data analysis project where I worked with the iconic Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights using Python and key data science tools like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

🔍 Here's what I did:

Explored and cleaned the data using .info(), .describe(), .value_counts(), and more
Handled missing values with fillna() and identified outliers
Visualized relationships and trends using:
pairplot() to examine feature interactions
heatmap() to understand correlations
Histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots for deeper insights

Summarized key findings based on age, class, fare, and survival rate

🧠 Key Insight: Passengers in higher classes and younger age groups had significantly higher survival rates.

📌 Tools used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

This project helped strengthen my skills in data wrangling, visual storytelling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) — crucial steps in any data science pipeline.
